### 01 / What is it ?

To witness future potential of EEG devices i have developed a car simulation/game that shows 
EEG devices can be used in health and entertainment together.
I have created 3D virtual space using UNITY 3D game / physics engine.
And i have created a car that would control with brain signals
Car's suspension and control code developed with C# , model itself is free to get from asset store

### 02 / Input System
Input system of this vehicle is very simple. Car is moving on 20 m/s automatically in beginning to NORTH (0,0,0) direction.
if user pass attention threshold it will become faster periodically.
If user want to slower the car it needs to pass meditation threshold periodically

### 03 / Move Around

To move user need to pass eye blinking strength threshold so car can move fixed direction.
Starting from NORTH EAST SOUTH WEST and NORTH again.
This way I have emulated very complex situation with a lot of inputs being  used and with only 3 inputs available.
