### 01 / Purpose

This application developed ALS patients in mind.Inspired by Stephen Hawking's writing machine . I have developed a similar but very cheap alternative with Python and headset.This way users can write the letter on screen by focusing on the letter.

### 02 / How does it works ?

In the screen letters are sliding to next each other with 250ms second delay. If user focuses on letter it want to write it can simply cross threshold value.
User either can choose attention,meditation or eye blinking strength to choose which is most preferable to use. 
By my tests I have found 65 appropriate value for threshold.

### 03 / Output

Using Python's library user can see focused letters on screen real time.
This way people can forward this writing to emails,websites and limitless other options.
