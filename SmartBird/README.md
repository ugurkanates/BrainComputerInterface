### 01 / Smart Bird
In Smart Bird application inspired by Flappy bird on mobile devices
user simply chooses which mode and trying to pass threshold of that mode. This way bird can jump around pipes.
Even though this is indeed hard application with traditional input systems it is very flexible to do it in EEG.

### 02 / Brain Tennis
In Brain Tennis  the player  compete against CPU component i wrote . CPU simply focuses on length between ball and itself to figure out input.Player is moving automatically and withing threshold passed it moves to opposite direction.
 With intense testing user can have enjoyable game using EEG.
### 03 / Conclusion
 I have tried to show how EEG devices can be useful collaborating with other tech. It is very hopeful future for EEG devices and tech
